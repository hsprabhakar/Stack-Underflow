You'll see it's the GPU diode that's burning up. The rest should be hunky dory, at least 12 degrees centigrade below that piece of... extraordinary nVidia technology which I will forever remember for this snafu.</p>\n\n<p>Long answer: I currently have one of those pre-Unibody 17\" MBPs, with the faulty nVidias. Oh yeah, I'm so happy, I can hardly hold it in.</p>\n\n<p>It initially ran at about 75 degrees Centigrade when I used it. After putting it on a smcfancontrol diet and keeping the fans revved up to 4500 as a default, everything was hunky dory except it still ran at about 69 degrees and was burning my forearms (though I love it in the winter).</p>\n\n<p>Long story short: bought a wireless keyboard, turned the fans down to their standard 2000, 4 weeks later I'm the proud owner of an MBP with a dead nVidia chip on it. Luckily, I had Apple Care so everything was fixed literally without any questions. The new logic board had the gpu diode running at 63 degrees for the first two weeks (with fans turned down). Now their default has become 72 degrees with the fans at 4000. I think I'm going to turn smcfancontrol off, make the default 2000 again and let it burn.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how many dead nVidias I have to get in so that Apple replaces my notebook with a version that doesn't have a crappy nVidia card in it.</p>\n",

        "Body": "<p>As to your first inquiry, Jailbreaking was illegal because of the way the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act\">Digital Millenium Copyright Act</a> restricts the circumvention of encryption, copy protection, and other digital security mechanisms. In short, it is not so much the possession of a jailbroken phone which was illegal, but rather the process by which the phone was jailbroken. A common analogy is to liken the DMCA's restriction to a law preventing the crossing of red lines in the road. If there is a public park on the other side of the red line, it is legal for you to be there, but illegal to walk across the line to get there. The recent LoC ruling essentially created an exception to the DMCA's restriction for the specific purpose of jailbreaking a phone for the purpose of installing additional software and expanding it's functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as to Why Jailbreak? In short, Jailbreak if there is an application you want to run which requires you to jailbreak. Apps available through Cydia and other repositories available to Jailbroken iPhone owners run the gamut from those rejected by Apple because they violate the App Stores Terms of Service in some way (Explicit content, use of hidden or illegal API's), apps from authors who disagree with Apples policies in administering the App Store, and apps which rely on functionality only available from other jailbreak apps.</p>\n",

The \"bundle\" is simply a folder that finder interprets as an application. Applications can (and are often) \"patched\" by modifying files withing these <code>.app</code> folders.

The fact that it is also where they handle a lot of their DRM (which they may have contractual obligations to update in some instances) probably is part of the reason as well.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental issue with delta patches is that they are more complex, and have higher support costs for the vendor. A full updater can run against any version of the app that is installed, a delta patcher most be made against specific version. A full updater will work regardless of whether the app has been modified (user hacking the binary to do something, tweaking the artwork, etc), a delta updater will fail against a modified app.</p>\n\n<p>Given the extra work involved in preparing a delta patch, and the increased chance that it won't work, they tend to only be used in very specific cases. Apple tends to create delta updates for software updates, but they only create a delta against the most recent released version of the OS, rather than making dozens of versions that work with every release they make the one that will get most people, and then for everyone else they do a combo update that is a full updater that also incorporates every previous software update as well.</p>\n\n<p>For smaller things like iTunes, they don't tend to bother with delta updates at all due to the increased workload, support, the increased number of versions that exist, and the fact that iTunes is fairly small in the scheme of things (it is smaller than an OS update, or an iPhone/iPad firmware).</p>\n",

This will fully charge the iPad in a few hours, even if you\u2019re using the iPad at the same time.</li>\n  <li>When connected to a high-power USB port\u2014such as the ones on recent Macs and the iPhone Power Adapter\u2014the iPad will charge, even during use, but more slowly. (We haven\u2019t yet determined how much more slowly.) Some third-party powered USB hubs provide higher-power USB ports, but many don\u2019t; similarly, the USB ports on most Windows PCs don\u2019t provide this additional power.</li>\n  <li>When connected to lower-power USB ports\u2014those on older Macs, most Windows PCs, and most USB hubs (powered or unpowered)\u2014the iPad\u2019s battery is not charged while the iPad is awake, but is charged (again, slowly) when the iPad is asleep. What\u2019s confusing here is that the message \"Not charging\" appears in the menu bar when the iPad is awake, which might lead you to assume that the offending USB port can never charge  your iPad. But rest assured, Apple says: once you put the iPad to sleep, the battery will indeed charge. (If you could see the screen while the iPad was asleep, it might even display the charging icon. It\u2019s the modern-day \u201cDoes the refrigerator light stay on when I close the door?\u201d mystery.)</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>Further analysis from Apple's statements indicate that the iPad can only be charged off of USB connections that provide near 1 amp of current. The majority of USB ports on most older Macs and PCs only provide 500 mA and thus can't be used to charge the device. </p>\n  \n  <p>The USB 2.0 specification provides 500 mA of current to high-powered buses and 100 mA for low-powered buses. But in April 2009, the specification gained a new \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Power\">Battery Charging Specification</a>\" which provided additional current to high power devices and it seems that Apple has started to incorporate it in their newer Macs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Part of this is because of the limited RAM available on iOS devices along with the fact that Apple doesn't write any cached items to the flash memory and only keeps it in the memory.

When I go to <code>http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/</code>, WordPress can't find any posts from the database: It gives me the \"Sorry, no posts met your criteria\" message (which is built into the theme for when a search for posts returns nothing). N.B.: Apache processes the PHP code normally in both cases -- but in one case WordPress can get posts from MySQL, and in the other case it can't.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was that this was a problem with WordPress's configuration, so I changed the WordPress URL to <code>http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/</code>, but this made no difference. </p>\n\n<p>I don't understand why using the two addresses produces different results. Any help appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>(Here's why I care, in case you're wondering: I want to preview the site in BBEdit's web preview window, and BBEdit will only load the site via the <code>http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/</code> address.)</p>\n",

If your current Battery capacity is under 25% it may very well be a good time to get a new battery. Under 10% for sure. If the new battery is less than 50% battery capacity in less than 6 months give AppleCare a call, they do have a warranty on their batteries but it's relatively limited.</p>\n",

To enable it, <a href=\"http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090913140023382\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">read this</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Snow Leopard has the ability to mount NTFS volumes as read/write, but it's not enabled by default -- just read only is supported, as in 10.5. Here's how to get full read/write support for NTFS drives in Snow Leopard. First, uninstall NTFS-3G or Paragon if you're using either one.</p>\n<p>Here's how to get read/write support for NTFS drives in Snow Leopard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In Terminal, type diskutil info /Volumes/volume_name, where volume_name is the name of the NTFS volume. From the output, copy the Volume UUID value to the clipboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Back up /etc/fstab if you have it; it shouldn't be there in a default install.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Type sudo nano /etc/fstab.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the editor, type UUID=, then paste the UUID number you copied from the clipboard. Type a Space, then type none ntfs rw. The final line should look like this: UUID=123-456-789 none ntfs rw, where 123-456-789 is the UUID you copied in the first step.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Repeat the above steps for any other NTFS drives/partitions you have.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Save the file and quit nano (Control-X, Y, Enter), then restart your system.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After rebooting, NTFS partitions should natively have read and write support. This works with both 32- and 64-bit kernels. Support is quite good and fast, and it even recognizes file attributes such as hidden files. My thanks go to Chrysaor, a MacRumors user who brought this to our attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alternately, you could use <a href=\"http://ntfsmounter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NTFSMounter</a>, for a GUI utility to do the same thing.</p>\n",

I entered the correct passcode, and it loaded for a split second, then the prompt swiped to the left, to show the same screen, asking me to enter my passcode. It almost seems like a glitch or problem with the actual OS of some kind,as no matter how many times I enter the passcode, it prompts me to enter it again. I know it is the correct passcode, because as a test, I had entered an incorrect one, only to see the screen shake and tell me it was wrong. So that shouldn't be the problem.\nThere's no other way I can reset this password for iCloud, so this is my only hope.\nI also just thought, 'well at this point it doesn't matter, I don't store anything on my iPhone anyway', and tried to factory reset it, to be prompted to enter my iCloud password, so there's no way out that I know of.\nThanks for any reply or help, and forgive my ignorance,\ntspad</p>\n",

I\u2019m received an engineering call back and they will ship a new keyboard to me so they can have this back. Not sure they will scrap it or analyze it, but for me I\u2019ll wait for a second keyboard to test.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The triage steps I didn\u2019t think of are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>open Accessability in general settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the keyboard is connected, you should see pointer control. Remove the iPad from the keyboard and the pointer option should vanish instantly. Reconnect and then make sure you turn off all the items: Automatically Hide, etc... and make the color / size large to be sure it\u2019s not on screen and not visible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FC7aM.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FC7aM.jpg\" alt=\"Pointer Control settings on iPadOS 13.5\" /></a></p>\n<p>If your connectors are dirty, you won\u2019t get the immediate change in pointer control. Also, inspect your keyboard closely under a brigh light for any hairline cracks or physical damage. If it got wet, that could cause the trackpad to fail.</p>\n",

For example, Apple FS's have as standard, two forks (though they may technically have any number).  The data fork contains most of what we usually think of of file data, along with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resource fork</a>, often but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(file_system)#Apple\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not solely used by executables</a>.  (And though that wikipedia link does not mention the resource fork in APFS, they <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20629961\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">do still exit</a> there.)  There is other metadata, including that for the Finder program and \"a separate area for metadata distinct from either the data or resource fork...  However, the amount of data stored here is minimal, being just the creation and modification timestamps, the file type and creator codes, fork lengths, and the file name.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>An Approach that Puts Off Part of the Problem by Backing up to an Apple Formatted Disk</strong></p>\n\n<p>One approach is to backup your present files using some Mac solution that will keep copies of your files on an HFS+ or APFS filesystem.  When the time comes to move to linux, you will have your files and be able to read them (though not write) using linux's <code>hfsutils</code>, <code>hfsprogs</code> and <code>hfsplus</code> or, <a href=\"https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>apfs-fuse</code></a>(<a href=\"https://linuxnewbieguide.org/how-to-mount-macos-apfs-disk-volumes-in-linux/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">installation tutorial</a>), <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/file_systems\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>apfsprogs-git</code> &amp; <code>linux-apfs-dkms-git</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure that your backup system does not store your files in some proprietary archive format that you will not be able to read under linux, which may happen if you are not using a cross-platform tool.  For-fee solutions include <a href=\"https://www.belightsoft.com/products/getbackup/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Get Backup Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chronosync-express/id904801687?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CronoSync Express</a>.  While the first would be a true backup (keeping historical copies of files), the second could be either a backup or a simple mirror.  It is possible that TimeMachine might also work, though you will have to confirm that it doesn't use an archive format unreadable under linux.  You just want an APFS filesystem, with you files copied to it.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Later You Will Want to Use Your Files on Linux</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, for the purposes of your question you will in addition want to know how to represent all of your files in a <em>usable way</em> on some linux filesystem.  Clearly the Finder data is of no use, and you will have to lose HFS+'s \"birthtime\" attribute (see below), because that is not tracked in Linux.  The data fork contains the bulk of the information, but what relevance the resource fork and some of the other metadata may have, will depend on the file.  How problematic this may become for you, may not be clear until you try.</p>\n\n<p>The following approaches will allow you to save all of your MacOS data instead to a linux formatted disk, thereby doing without Mac backup software or TimeMachine, etc., and also dispensing with the later need to read an Apple disk under linux; though you will still then be faced with the question of proper use of that data under linux.  You may do well to consider this article, \"<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100116001659/https://developer.apple.com/macosx/backuponmacosx.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Command Line Backup Solutions on Mac OS X</a>,\" before proceeding.  As discussed in that article, be careful to note that using MacOS's resource fork aware version of rsync (or tar) will produce output that is not usable by linux's version or rsync or tar!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backing up to a linux disk with rsync</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a project called <a href=\"https://quesera.com/reynhout/misc/rsync+hfsmode/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>rsync+hfsmode</code></a> that will handle backing up to linux formatted disks properly, at least for HFS+, but it does it by creating two files on the backup drive: <code>filename</code>, containing the data fork, and <code>._filename</code> containing the resource fork and Finder metadata.  Furthermore, when copying back to an HFS+ disk, a second step is needed to reconstitute those two files into a proper HFS+ data structure.  You can see a more complete discussion at <a href=\"https://quesera.com/reynhout/misc/rsync+hfsmode/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the project page</a>.  The <em>filename</em>/<em>._filename</em> system for storing HFS+/APFS files to other filesystems, has a name.  It is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleSingle_and_AppleDouble_formats\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AppleDouble</a> format. \n I am not clear if this same approach will work for APFS, though <a href=\"https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/124811\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the question</a> asked on the Apple Developer Forum was responded to with silence; so perhaps not.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backing up to any kind of disk with dar</strong></p>\n\n<p>Disk Archiver (<a href=\"http://dar.linux.free.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>dar</code></a>), which is cross-platform and available in <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Homebrew</a>, can handle the unique characteristics of MacOS filesystems (they do not distinguish between HFS+ and APFS, but say they can handle extended attributes, including file forks).  According to their <a href=\"http://dar.linux.free.fr/doc/Features.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Features page</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>EXTENDED ATTRIBUTES (EA) references: MacOS X FILE FORKS / ACL\n  Dar is able to save and restore EA, all or just those matching a given pattern.</p>\n  \n  <p>File Forks (MacOS X) are implemented over EA as well as Linux's ACL,\n  they are thus transparently saved, tested, compared and restored by\n  dar. Note that ACL under MacOS seem to not rely on EA, thus while they\n  are marginally used they are ignored by dar.</p>\n  \n  <p>FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES (FSA) references: \n  MacOSX/FreeBSD Birthdate, Linux FS attributes </p>\n  \n  <p>Since release 2.5.0 dar is able to take care of filesystem specific\n  attributes. Those are grouped by family strongly linked to the\n  filesystem they have been read from, but perpendicularly each FSA is\n  designated also by a function. This way it is possible to translate\n  FSA from a filesystem into another filesystem when there is a\n  equivalency in role.</p>\n  \n  <p>currently two families are present: HFS+ family contains only one\n  function : the birthtime. In addition to ctime, mtime and atime, dar\n  can backup, compare and restore all four dates of a given inode (well,\n  ctime is not possible to restore)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I also had <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/dar/mailman/dar-support/?viewmonth=202006&amp;viewday=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some discussion</a> on these issues with the developer.</p>\n\n<p>Since dar is cross-platform, you don't have to worry about the format it stores the files in, since you'll also be able to install dar on linux, when it is time to move there.  In this case it probably makes sense to format your backup disk as some linux filesystem.  You could use APFS if you wanted, as it's also readable under linux, but that seems pointless.</p>\n\n<p>Restoring to a linux disk will produce error messages when metadata can not be reproduced.  You will be able to save the problematic files in a smaller archive.  Whether you can explore the attributes of those failing files using linux tools, I am not yet clear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backing up to Any Kind of Disk Using Restic</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://restic.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Restic</code></a> is similarly cross-platform and <a href=\"https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/Manual/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">available in Homebreaw</a>, and can handle Apple disks.  (Though again, they do not distinguish HFS+ from APFS.)  There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1622\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">detailed bug report</a> describing how <code>restic</code> behaves when backing up HFS+, showing what it is able to handle and where it fails.  </p>\n\n<p>Similarly to <code>dar</code>, restoring to a linux disk will produce error messages when metadata can not be reproduced.  Whether you will be able to manipulate or save those problematic files separately, I am not yet clear.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a short description of its <a href=\"https://forum.restic.net/t/is-there-an-introductory-guide-for-non-techie-mac-users/526/2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">installation and use</a> in MacOS, along with a <a href=\"https://forum.restic.net/t/example-scheduling-regular-backups-on-macos/104\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">scheduler</a>.</p>\n",

After various fruitless attempts at restarting and hoping for the install to happen, I decided to try installing manually and downloaded the update.

This was odd as I had about 15Gb, which I thought would be enough.</p>\n\n<p>After clearing out some old files I eventually got to 28Gb free and tried to install the update again. It still failed with the message that there wasn't enough disk space. Using the DaisyDisk utility I looked at how much disk space I had and noticed that of the 28Gb that was free, only 10Gb was really free and the other 18Gb was purgeable. My guess is that the Installer program only checks truly free space and given that the actual update itself is around 9Gb, it probably decided that there wasn't enough space to do an install.</p>\n\n<p>So I used the DaisyDisk utility to do a proper purge of the purgeable space i.e. truly cleaning the files in it off the disk. I now had 28Gb of genuine free space and the install proceeded without a hitch. If the install keeps failing using the Software Update approach, it may be an idea to try a manual install as that seems to at least give you an error message to work with.</p>\n",

(usually, that is) It is also the only way to take advantage of features like ask to purchase, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The Apple ID that is used device-wide, i.e. for the iCloud features, iTunes/App Stores, etc. should be the child's account \u2013 the top of the Settings app should display your child's name and account for the Apple ID settings menu.</p>\n\n<p>When you set up screen time, or other parental management feature, a login prompt will come up, probably somewhere around when you set up the management passcode. Here, you need to log into the guardian or family organizer Apple ID.</p>\n\n<p>But you can avoid this confusion by configuring Screen Time for your child's device from your own Mac, iOS device, or iPad, if you have one. Turn on Screen Time in family sharing and it will allow you to manage your child's device from the Settings app or System Preferences on your own device remotely, kind of like a cute mini version of an MDM deployment :)</p>\n",

Would appreciate any advice you might have.</p>\n\n<p>When I opened the new computer, I turned it on and made a new account just to make sure it worked. Seeing that it did, I began the data migration process from my old MBP (still running Mojave) using Migration Assistant. The migration seemed to be going ridiculously slowly to the point that I thought it was frozen. I then realized that I could get all the data from Time Machine on my backup drive, so I cancelled the process.</p>\n\n<p>To make sure I had a clean start again, I rebooted the new computer in recovery mode and reinstalled MacOS Catalina. But unfortunately this stopped halfway through claiming there was an internet problem (I was seated right next to my router).</p>\n\n<p>After this point, whenever I restarted the computer, it would either flash the folder with the question mark (i.e. no bootable drive found) or it would enter internet recovery mode. In the case of the latter, I would enter my wifi password and then it would gyrate for about 10 minutes until it gave up, showing the failed globe icon along with the message \"apple.com/support <code>-2002F</code>\". I wasn't able to enter the typical recovery menu at all.</p>\n\n<p>Now no matter what I do, it boots into internet recovery mode: booting up normally, holding CMD + R, holding Option + Cmd + R, etc. I have created and inserted two bootable USB drives into the computer, one with Catalina and the other with Mojave. When I hold Option while starting up, it correctly displays the two drives (and the wifi menu underneath). But when either is selected, it goes back into internet recovery mode anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else experienced problems like this? Anything else I can try? I'm very excited to use my new machine but this is proving to be immensely frustrating so far. Thanks for your time!</p>\n",

        "Body": "<h3>A Brief Survey of webp Support in macOS, 5/29/20:</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: Nearly 3 years after the OP's question, it seems the answer remains the same: \"webp is not well-supported in macOS\".</strong></p>\n\n<p>It appears that after <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ios-macos-tests-googles-webp-graphics-to-speed-up-web/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">briefly supporting <code>webp</code> in a beta release of macOS Sierra</a>, Apple decided against it. AFAIK, Apple provided no rationale or explanation for this decision (no surprise there). This may lead some to speculate that it was a petty motivation - as a Google product, perhaps it's the \"not invented here\" syndrome? I'll stick my neck out, and speculate that Apple will never support webp. Note also that <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Safari is notably absent from the list of browsers supporting webp.</a></p>\n\n<p>As @Allan mentioned, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google has provided a webp library</a>, and they have published <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the sources for their webp library</a>. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/webp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GitHub repo for webp</a>, but it's an empty facade - perhaps to prevent others from creating a repo under that name?</p>\n\n<p>Google's licensing appears to be non-standard. I won't comment further as I'm a layperson in IP matters.</p>\n\n<p>Google's webp library <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">includes several command-line utilities</a>. It can be installed with MacPorts (<code>sudo port install webp</code>). For me (my <em>use case</em>), the utilities are useless: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>They provide no useful conversions, as they do not decode <strong>to</strong> the GIF format. </p></li>\n<li><p><em>Animated</em> webp files are crudely rendered by <code>vwebp</code> via OpenGL in one size only. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/339810/149366\">One of the answers here</a> references the <a href=\"https://github.com/emin/WebPQuickLook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WebPQuickLook</a> repo on GitHub. But as of this writing, this repo appears to be abandoned as there have been no changes to the repo files in 2 years. </p>\n\n<p>The macOS App Store has several utilities that claim some level of support for webp. I've not tried them, but I generally shun the App Store due to several poor experiences. </p>\n",

I held down <kbd>shift</kbd> while powering back on and once again, got Apple logo with progress bar which took a long time to reach the end.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxNv3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxNv3.jpg\" alt=\"Apple logo with progress bar at boot\"></a></p>\n\n<p>When it got to 100% (as in, it visually looks like it is - photo above was taken before it got to the end), it just sits there for a long time (in fact, it's still showing on the screen now and it's been about 30 minutes - surprisingly, the monitor would usually have lost signal by now).</p>\n\n<p>Throughout all of this, I've tried various things online including:-</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Booting into safe mode.</li>\n<li>Resetting NVRAM and PRAM.</li>\n<li>Booting into macOS Recovery System.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Nothing I try seems to make a difference. If I do get a signal to monitor, every time, it just displays the Apple logo with progress bar that takes an age to reach the end and then back to no signal.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I have though as well is that I don't have a Mac keyboard connected, only a standard Windows ones so I'm not entirely sure if I'm even getting the equivalent keyboard strokes correct at boot.</p>\n\n<p>I'm reluctant to go back to the IT repair shop as I think the same thing will just happen so I'm keen to try and get to the bottom of this myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Could anyone advise what I can try or ask me to do something and feed back the outcome in order for someone to pinpoint the issue and get this fixed once and for all.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If it is of any use:-</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There appears to be no issue at all with the device itself powering on/off.</li>\n<li>There is no unusual sounds or noises coming from the device itself and I hear the power on chime as expected.</li>\n<li>I'm now testing with known working hardware configuration (HDMI direct from device to working modern high resolution monitor).</li>\n<li>I'm not really bothered if anything has to be rolled back or data erased.</li>\n<li>I am unable to confirm the current macOS installed as I can't get it to the login screen but I think it was macOS Catalina.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Edit 4th June 2020</h1>\n\n<p>Finally got a chance to try the <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/392474/mac-mini-wont-boot-past-apple-logo-and-progress-bar-after-having-to-do-a-hard-b#comment538897_392474\">comment by Allan</a> and for the first time, by holding <kbd>Cmd</kbd> (Windows key) + <kbd>R</kbd> at boot, I have finally managed to get something else to come up which looks like the below macOS Utilities:-</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3p2xg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3p2xg.jpg\" alt=\"macOS Utilities\"></a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Edit 4th June 2020</h1>\n\n<p>Disk utilities and performing first aid on the disk ran successfully and found no problems so I attempted to reinstall macOS (Mojave) on the disk and would not let me select the disk and produced the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>This disk has SMART errors.\n\nThis disk has a hardware problem that can't be repaired.

        "Body": "<p>I guess tha the \"coaxial\" part you refer to is actually just a shield. The shield is made from a fine wire that is \"braided\", and runs the length of the cable. I'm not privy to Apple's designs or schematics, but most likely the shield is there for EMC (electromagnetic compatibility), and not as a current-conducting ground wire. Using a shield as a conductor would be unusual to say the least. </p>\n\n<p>That said, any damage to the shield is unlikely to affect the <strong>function</strong> of your cable. </p>\n\n<p>However, the insulation on the wires in the cable should be checked for evidence of cracking, fraying or other deterioration. It's important all of the <em>inner wires</em> (inside the shield) are in good condition. You have done the right thing by mending the cable with electrical tape: it's an insulator and it's flexible. As long as the electrical tape is in place, and in good condition, I don't believe the cable poses any risk to you, or to your Mac. </p>\n\n<p>I had the same problem as you recently on my Magsafe cable. The outer insulation in one area on the cable just began breaking down, and falling off the cable! I've <strong>never</strong> seen wiring insulation behave like this. I also used electrical tape as a <em>temporary</em> solution. I was able to find this <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B07S3GQ9CX\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">replacement Magsafe cable on Amazon</a>. This cable allows me to use one of the new USB-C chargers to charge my 2011 Macbook Pro. I've been using it for several months now &amp; it works. </p>\n\n<p>It appears from the picture you have the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-11-apple-magsafe-vs-magsafe-2-photos-incompatible-power-connectors.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">newer Magsafe 2 connector.</a>.

However, it seems they also have a version for the <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B07TZWB886\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">USB-C to Magsafe 2 cable</a> which may suit your situation. </p>\n",

Solution was to download additional tools for Xcode with lower version then 11.4 (version 9 worked for me) and then resetting it from there. Some more details <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/gqyglw/not_able_to_connect_bluetooth_headphones_anymore/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n",

I was trying to install Windows 10 via boot camp and it told me it could not due to some issue and to check Disk Utility. I have used Linux and Windows to a lesser degree most of my life, but I am embarrassed to say I don't fully understand this. I ran <code>diskutil list</code> &amp; <code>diskutil apfs list</code> and this is the output. I saw these commands on some other post and thought they may be helpful. This is probably completely normal. I am sure I just want to understand. I am on the newest update of Catalina MBP Mid 2017. Also, it is not super important to get Boot Camp running Windows. I was just experimenting, but does anyone see an obvious reason why there would be an issue?

I've got a required \"metal capable\" graphics card (Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX580), which unfortunately does not support the Startup Manager.  I want access to the Startup Manager, to be able to access recovery partitions and bootable external media.</p>\n\n<p>My plan: rEFInd seems like a good solution to my problem. Before installing the unsupported GPU, if I can get rEFInd to appear as an option in the Startup Manager, I can select it as the default using the control key when selecting the boot option (this <em>does</em> work on my machine).  Then once I install the unsupported GPU, the rEFInd main screen will appear on startup and I can select whatever I want, including recovery partitions and external media. (Obviously I must be careful never to change the default in SystemPrefs->StartupDisk, or I'll have to temporarily re-install the old GPU and change the default back to rEFInd !).   Does this sound like a workable plan ?</p>\n\n<p>I've installed rEFInd, with default options, and it does not appear in Startup Manager.   To get it  to appear in Startup Manager, I believe I need to reinstall it with the --usedefault option.   How do I reinstall ?   Do I need to uninstall first (since I first installed it without the usedefault option) ?  Uninstalling looks somewhat problematic.   And what argument do I need to use with --usedefault ?   I've looked at a wiki and a manpage, but am still confused.  When I ran 'mountesp', I got:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo mountesp\nThe ESP has been identified as /dev/disk0s1; attempting to mount it....\nThe ESP is mounted at /Volumes/ESP\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only file in that volume is: /Volumes/ESP/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap</p>\n\n<p>That's it.

Then <code>sudo nano</code>into the same directory, and write \"MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5 [PathToExecutable]/[CurrentRenamedExecutableName]\", and <em>voil\u00e0</em>, you get both the app to launch with that mode on, and you inherit both the icon and the notifications</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, ATTENTION!!!!

At the Apple Store, I ended up just connecting the two phones together to do the data transfer, so I didn't end up needing the iTunes backup from my PC after all. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to last week, my iPhone stopped working, and since shelter in place is still in full effect in CA, I had to send my phone in and they sent me a new replacement today. Since it stopped working suddenly, I wasn't able to get my current data back, but I fortunately still have the backup I made in February. Problem is, it is asking for a decryption pass code that I never created (at least not within the last 10 years). </p>\n\n<p>I have called Apple Support, and they told me that they have no way of accessing or resetting this password, does anyone have any idea what it could have been? Could it have been a password that I entered when I first setup my Apple ID in 2008? Could it have been a password I set on another computer? </p>\n\n<p>This backup contains years of photos of travelling, life events, and moments with those who have passed away. Any help would be graciously appreciated. </p>\n",

For example, my HDD had around 500GB of data and it took around 5 minutes before it was automatically mounted and working as expected. In the meantime, I was unable to mount and to eject the disk (the error was the same, the disk was in use by another process). Simply plug in the disk and let the OS do the check it needs (some other users might know more about what is going on in the background and feel free to edit my comment to extend the knowledge). Patience, it will mount itself automatically after it finished all the background checks :)</p>\n",

The only option is a hard power-off and on again.  </p>\n\n<p>This was annoying but it happened infrequently enough that I could live with it.  </p>\n\n<p>After upgrading to Catalina 15.5 the situation has become a lot worse.  I find that the catatonic issue happens almost every time I try to wake the computer after attaching it to the dock, and now I've just had an incident where I was listening to the Music app.  The energy saver turned the monitor off as expected, but then the Music app stopped responding to the Remote app on my phone.  When I tried logging back in I found that once again the computer had gone catatonic.  It hadn't crashed because the music was still paying, but once again the monitors wouldn't switch on and it wouldn't respond to input.  Again, the only option I had was a hard restart.  </p>\n\n<p>For now I've turned off the energy saver so monitors never switch off whilst connected to power/on the dock, but that's only a workaround, not a fix.  </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else encountered this?

I wanted to make it ignore the mouse temporarily, so using the Logitech control panel I unpaired the mouse. Unfortunately the trackpad didn't come back, so I had no mouse control at all, even after rebooting.  </p>\n\n<p>As recommended <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/392435/my-trackpad-doesnt-work-on-my-mbp-when-i-unpaired-logitech-mouse\">here</a>, I managed to reboot in safe mode which gave me the trackpad back, and I ran the Logitech Uninstaller. Rebooted normally, and trackpad worked. However, when I plug the dongle into the USB port, the trackpad stops working.</p>\n\n<p>I tried reinstalling Logitech Unifying Spftware, but it won't proceed until I plug in the dongle, and when I do that, again the trackpad freezes!</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas on solving this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I confirmed - the trackpad freezes when I insert the transceiver in the USB port, <em>even after I ran the Uninstaller and rebooted.</em> This seems odd - but I don't know enough about USB to know what happens when you plug in something without its control software installed. </p>\n\n<p>Does this sound more like a non-Logitech problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: I discovered that the problem doesn't occur when I log in as my other userid. </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>: The System Report/USB page identifies the Logitech receiver when it's plugged in, so it's obviously able to communicate with it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Now It Works</strong>: What I did: switch to my alternate, \"clean\" user, and installed Logitech Unifying Software there. The mouse worked. Switched to primary user, where I've been having the issue, and installed Logitech Unifying Software there (for like the 4th time). Now the mouse works in the primary user.</p>\n",

I wanted to do the same, so I followed all the normal steps to create links for /Applications (also tried with /System/Volume/Data/Applications). But it does not work at all.
